# Fake News Detection using Mistral7B

This repository contains the necessary files and resources for the "Fake News Detection using Mistral7B" Honors Project by Arman DoÄŸru at the University of Ottawa. The project utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to improve the detection and classification of fake news across multiple domains.

## Directory Structure

- **datasets/**: Contains raw datasets.
- **preprocessed_datasets/**: Datasets prepared after running the preprocessing scripts.
- **baseline/**: Selected combination of datasets used in our training.
- **baseline_ipynb/**: Jupyter notebook file for baseline model training.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Resources

- **Kaggle Workspaces**: [Kaggle Collections](https://www.kaggle.com/work/collections/13498905) for GPU-heavy trainings.
- **Weights and Biases Reports**: Detailed model training and performance metrics can be viewed at [WANDB Reports](https://api.wandb.ai/links/arman-dogru/cwnd0apz).
